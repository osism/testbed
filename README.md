# OSISM testbed

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=documentation&color=blue)](https://osism.github.io/docs/guides/deploy-guide/examples/testbed)

With the OSISM Testbed, it is possible to run a full [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community)
deployment on an existing OpenStack environment such as Cleura or REGIO.cloud.

OSISM is the reference implementation for the infrastructure as a service layer
in the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project. The OSISM Testbed is therefore used
in the SCS project to test and work on the Instrastructure as a Service layer.

The OSISM Testbed is intended as a playground. Further services and integration
will be added over time. More and more best practices and experiences from the
productive deployments will be included here in the future. It will become more
production-like over time. However, at no point does it claim to represent a
production setup exactly.
