With this testbed, it is possible to run a full OSISM installation, the baseline
of the Sovereign Cloud Stack, on an existing OpenStack environment such as
City Cloud or Open Telekom Cloud.

For the German-speaking readers, `iX 2020/12 <https://www.osism.tech/files/ix.2020.12.048_059.pdf_kiosk.pdf>`_
contains an article by Kurt Garloff titled
"`Wolken-Verbund <https://www.osism.tech/files/ix.2020.12.048_059.pdf_kiosk.pdf>`_",
in which, among other things, the OSISM testbed is briefly introduced.
