Wireguard
=========

* deployment

  .. code-block:: console

     osism-run custom wireguard

* client configuration

  .. code-block:: console

     [Interface]
     PrivateKey = eFvxE9jOhSRg4drIUBEO1xqHP9cpV0bQiGASFqvGMkU=
     Address = 192.168.60.4/24

     [Peer]
     PublicKey = MANAGER_CONTENTS_OF_/etc/wireguard/osism.pub
     PresharedKey = MANAGER_CONTENTS_OF_/etc/wireguard/osism.psk
     AllowedIPs = 192.168.60.5/32, 192.168.50.0/24, 192.168.90.0/24, 192.168.100.0/24
     Endpoint = MANAGER_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS:51820

Change versions
===============

* Go to ``/opt/configuration`` on the manager node
* Run ``./scripts/set-openstack-version.sh stein`` to set the OpenStack version to ``stein``
* Run ``./scripts/set-ceph-version.sh nautilus`` to set the Ceph version to ``nautilus``
* Go to ``/home/dragon`` on the manager node
* Run ``ansible-playbook manager-part-2.yml`` to update the manager

This can also be achieved automatically by passing the wanted versions inside the environment
``ceph_version`` and ``openstack_version`` respectively.

Deploy services
===============

* Infrastructure services

  .. code-block:: console

     /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy_infrastructure_services.sh

* Ceph services

  .. code-block:: console

     /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy_ceph_services.sh

* Basic OpenStack services

  .. code-block:: console

     /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy_openstack_services_basic.sh

* Additional OpenStack services

  .. code-block:: console

     /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy_openstack_services_additional.sh

Purge services
==============

These commands completely remove parts of the environment. This makes reuse possible
without having to create a completely new environment.

OpenStack & infrastructure services
-----------------------------------

.. code-block:: console

   osism-kolla _ purge
   Are you sure you want to purge the kolla environment? [no]: yes
   Are you really sure you want to purge the kolla environment? [no]: ireallyreallymeanit

Ceph
----

.. code-block:: console

   find /opt/configuration -name 'ceph*keyring' -exec rm {} \;
   osism-ceph purge-docker-cluster
   Are you sure you want to purge the cluster? Note that if with_pkg is not set docker
   packages and more will be uninstalled from non-atomic hosts. Do you want to continue?
    [no]: yes

Manager services
----------------

.. code-block:: console

   cd /opt/manager
   docker-compose down -v

Some services like phpMyAdmin or OpenStackClient will still run afterwards.

================ ========================== ======== ========================================

Ceph
----

Deploy `Ceph` first.

.. code-block:: console

   osism-run custom bootstraph-ceph-dashboard

.. figure:: /images/ceph-dashboard.png

Cockpit
-------

.. code-block:: console

   osism-generic cockpit
   osism-run custom generate-ssh-known-hosts

.. figure:: /images/cockpit.png

Netdata
-------

.. code-block:: console

   osism-infrastructure netdata

.. figure:: /images/netdata.png

Skydive
-------

Deploy `Clustered infrastructure services`, `Infrastructure services`, and `Basic OpenStack services` first.

.. code-block:: console

   osism-kolla deploy skydive

The Skydive agent creates a high load on the Open vSwitch services. Therefore the agent is only
started manually when needed.

.. code-block:: console

   osism-generic manage-container -e container_action=stop -e container_name=skydive_agent -l skydive-agent

Tools

Refstack
--------

.. code-block:: console

   /opt/configuration/contrib/refstack/refstack.sh

Check infrastructure services
-----------------------------

The contrib directory contains a script to check the clustered infrastructure services. The
configuration is so that two nodes are already sufficient.

.. code-block:: console

   cd /opt/configuration/contrib
   ./check_infrastructure_services.sh
   Elasticsearch   OK - elasticsearch (kolla_logging) is running. status: green; timed_out: false; number_of_nodes: 2; ...

   MariaDB         OK: number of NODES = 2 (wsrep_cluster_size)

   RabbitMQ        RABBITMQ_CLUSTER OK - nb_running_node OK (2) nb_running_disc_node OK (2) nb_running_ram_node OK (0)

   Redis           TCP OK - 0.002 second response time on 192.168.50.10 port 6379|time=0.001901s;;;0.000000;10.000000

Random data
-----------

The contrib directory contains some scripts to fill the components of the environment with random data.
This is intended to generate a realistic data load, e.g. for upgrades or scaling tests.

MySQL
~~~~~

After deployment of MariaDB including HAProxy it is possible to create four test databases each with
four tables which are filled with randomly generated data. The script can be executed multiple
times to generate more data.

.. code-block:: console

   cd /opt/configuration/contrib
   ./mysql_random_data_load.sh 100000

Elasticsearch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After deployment of Elasticsearch including HAProxy it is possible to create 14 test indices
which are filled with randomly generated data. The script can be executed multiple times to
generate more data.

14 indices are generated because the default retention time for the number of retained
indices is set to 14.

.. code-block:: console

   cd /opt/configuration/contrib
   ./elasticsearch_random_data_load.sh 100000
