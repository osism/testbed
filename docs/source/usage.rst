Wireguard
=========

* deployment (Wireguard is rolled out by default)

  .. code-block:: console

     osism-run custom wireguard

* client configuration

  .. code-block:: console

     [Interface]
     PrivateKey = eFvxE9jOhSRg4drIUBEO1xqHP9cpV0bQiGASFqvGMkU=
     Address = 192.168.48.4/24

     PublicKey = MANAGER_CONTENTS_OF_/etc/wireguard/osism.pub
     PresharedKey = MANAGER_CONTENTS_OF_/etc/wireguard/osism.psk

     Endpoint = MANAGER_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS:51820

Change versions
===============

* Go to ``/opt/configuration`` on the manager node
* Run ``./scripts/set-openstack-version.sh stein`` to set the OpenStack version to ``stein``
* Run ``./scripts/set-ceph-version.sh nautilus`` to set the Ceph version to ``nautilus``
* Go to ``/home/dragon`` on the manager node
* Run ``ansible-playbook manager-part-2.yml`` to update the manager

This can also be achieved automatically by passing the wanted versions inside the environment
``ceph_version`` and ``openstack_version`` respectively.

Deploy services
===============

* Basic infrastructure services (MariaDB, RabbitMQ, Redis, ..)

  .. code-block:: console

     /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy_infrastructure_services_basic.sh

* Extented infrastructure services (Patchman, phpMyAdmin, Cockpit, ..)

  .. code-block:: console

     /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy_infrastructure_services_extented.sh

* Ceph services

  .. code-block:: console

     /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy_ceph_services.sh

* Basic OpenStack services (Compute, Storage, ..)

  .. code-block:: console

     /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy_openstack_services_basic.sh

* Extented OpenStack services (Telemetry, Loadbalancer, Kubernetes, ..)

  .. code-block:: console

     /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy_openstack_services_extented.sh

* Additional OpenStack services (Rating, Container, ..)

  .. code-block:: console

     /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy_openstack_services_additional.sh

* Monitoring services (Netdata, Prometheus exporters, ..)

  .. code-block:: console

     /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy_monitoring_services.sh

Purge services
==============

These commands completely remove parts of the environment. This makes reuse possible
without having to create a completely new environment.

OpenStack & infrastructure services
-----------------------------------

.. code-block:: console

   osism-kolla _ purge
   Are you sure you want to purge the kolla environment? [no]: yes
   Are you really sure you want to purge the kolla environment? [no]: ireallyreallymeanit

Ceph
----

.. code-block:: console

   find /opt/configuration -name 'ceph*keyring' -exec rm {} \;
   osism-ceph purge-docker-cluster
   Are you sure you want to purge the cluster? Note that if with_pkg is not set docker
   packages and more will be uninstalled from non-atomic hosts. Do you want to continue?
    [no]: yes

Manager services
----------------

.. code-block:: console

   cd /opt/manager
   docker-compose down -v

Some services like phpMyAdmin or OpenStackClient will still run afterwards.

ARA

.. figure:: /images/ara.png

AWX
---

.. figure:: /images/awx.png

Ceph
----

Deploy `Ceph` first.

.. code-block:: console

   osism-run custom bootstraph-ceph-dashboard

.. figure:: /images/ceph-dashboard.png

Cockpit
-------

.. code-block:: console

   osism-generic cockpit
   osism-run custom generate-ssh-known-hosts

.. figure:: /images/cockpit.png

Keycloak
--------

.. code-block:: console

   osism-infrastructure keycloak

.. figure:: /images/keycloak.png

Netbox
------

Netbox is part of the manager and does not need to be deployed individually.

.. figure:: /images/netbox.png

Netdata
-------

.. code-block:: console

   osism-monitoring netdata

.. figure:: /images/netdata.png

Skydive
-------

Deploy `Clustered infrastructure services`, `Infrastructure services`, and
`Basic OpenStack services` first.

.. code-block:: console

   osism-kolla deploy skydive

The Skydive agent creates a high load on the Open vSwitch services. Therefore
the agent is only started manually when needed.

.. code-block:: console

   osism-generic manage-container -e container_action=stop -e container_name=skydive_agent -l skydive-agent

.. figure:: /images/skydive.png

Patchman
--------

.. code-block:: console

   osism-generic patchman-client
   osism-infrastructure patchman

Every night the package list of the clients is transmitted via cron. Initially
we transfer these lists manually.

.. code-block:: console

   osism-ansible generic all -m command -a patchman-client

After the clients have transferred their package lists for the first time the
database can be built by Patchman.

This takes some time on the first run. Later, this update will be done once a day
during the night via cron.

.. code-block:: console

   patchman-update

The previous steps can also be done with a custom playbook.

.. code-block:: console

   osism-run custom bootstrap-patchman

.. figure:: /images/patchman.png

Prometheus exporters
--------------------

Deploy `Clustered infrastructure services`, `Infrastructure services`, and
`Basic OpenStack services` first.

.. code-block:: console

   osism-kolla deploy prometheus

Zabbix
------

.. code-block:: console

   osism-monitoring zabbix-agent
   osism-monitoring zabbix

.. figure:: /images/zabbix.png

   At least one workload did not pass SLA criteria.

Check infrastructure services
-----------------------------

The contrib directory contains a script to check the clustered infrastructure services. The
configuration is so that two nodes are already sufficient.

.. code-block:: console

   cd /opt/configuration/contrib
   ./check_infrastructure_services.sh
   Elasticsearch   OK - elasticsearch (kolla_logging) is running. status: green; timed_out: false; number_of_nodes: 2; ...

   MariaDB         OK: number of NODES = 2 (wsrep_cluster_size)

   RabbitMQ        RABBITMQ_CLUSTER OK - nb_running_node OK (2) nb_running_disc_node OK (2) nb_running_ram_node OK (0)

   Redis           TCP OK - 0.002 second response time on 192.168.32.10 port 6379|time=0.001901s;;;0.000000;10.000000

Random data
-----------

The contrib directory contains some scripts to fill the components of the
environment with random data. This is intended to generate a realistic data
load, e.g. for upgrades or scaling tests.

MySQL
~~~~~

After deployment of MariaDB including HAProxy it is possible to create four
test databases each with four tables which are filled with randomly generated
data. The script can be executed multiple times to generate more data.

.. code-block:: console

   cd /opt/configuration/contrib
   ./mysql_random_data_load.sh 100000

Elasticsearch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After deployment of Elasticsearch including HAProxy it is possible to create 14 test indices
which are filled with randomly generated data. The script can be executed multiple times to
generate more data.

14 indices are generated because the default retention time for the number of retained
indices is set to 14.

.. code-block:: console

   cd /opt/configuration/contrib
   ./elasticsearch_random_data_load.sh 100000
