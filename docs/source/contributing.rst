How to contribute
=================

We welcome any issues, change requests or general feedback. Do not hestiate
to open an issue.

We use GitHub Issues to capture feature requests, feedback, bugs, etc. The
tracker is available at https://github.com/osism/testbed/issues. There are
no specific requirements for the creation of an issue. Error cases should
be described in such a way that they are directly reproducible. The more
outputs there are, the better.

We use GitHub pull requests for contributions. The use of pull requets is
documented under https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests.

The process in detail for the creation of a fork, branch etc. is documented at
https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests.

It is recommended to use the `GitHub CLI <https://cli.github.com>`_. Makes many steps easier.
