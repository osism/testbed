Infrastructure resources
========================

For an environment on a cloud
-----------------------------

To use this testbed, a project on an OpenStack cloud environment is required. Cinder
must be usable there as additional service.

The testbed requires the following resources when using the default flavors.

* 1 keypair
* 6 security groups (50 security group rules)
* 6 networks with 6 subnetworks
* 1 router
* 30 ports
* 1 floating IP address
* 9 volumes (min 90 GB) plus 140GB root disks (depends on flavors)
* 4 instances (28 VCPUs, 104 GByte memory)

For an environment on physical hardware
---------------------------------------

For an environment on a hypervisor
----------------------------------

If the testbed is to be deployed independently of the Terraform integration with
OpenStack, the following resources are required.

Each system needs a root disk with at least 30 GByte storage.

2 networks are required. A network with which the virtual systems can be accessed
and via which the virtual systems can communicate with the outside world. In addition,
a fully internal network.

* 1 virtual system which is used as manager and monitoring node (4 VCPUs, 16 GByte memory)
* 3 virtual systems which are used as control, compute and, storage nodes (8 VCPUs, 32 GByte memory)
  * 3 additional volumes per virtual system with at least 10 GByte storage each

Ubuntu 20.04 is to be used as the base image for the virtual systems.


Software
========

* ``make`` must be installed on the system

Ansible
-------

Ansible in a current version must be installed and usable on the local workstation.

Currently Ansible 6.x is supported.

Information on installing Ansible can be found in the Ansible
documentation: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html

Terraform
---------

Terraform in a current version must be installed and usable on the local workstation.

Currently Terraform 1.2.x is supported.

Information on installing Terraform can be found in the Terraform
documentation: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli


This repository
===============

The code for deploying the testbed is hosted in a git repository, you need to make
a local copy of it by running:

.. code-block:: console

   mkdir -p ~/src/github.com/osism
   git clone https://github.com/osism/testbed ~/src/github.com/osism/testbed

.. note::

   The repository can also be cloned to any other location. The path to this repository
   is set via the parameter ``basepath``.


Cloud access
============

.. note::

   The necessary files are located in the ``terraform`` directory.

There is a separate environment file, e.g. ``environments/betacloud.tfvars``, for
each supported cloud provider.

The environment to be used is set via the ``ENVIRONMENT`` environment variable.

.. code-block:: console

   export ENVIRONMENT=betacloud

* `Betacloud <https://www.betacloud.de>`_

  .. note::

     * The credentials are stored in ``clouds.yaml`` and ``secure.yaml`` with the name ``betacloud``.

     * To use the Betacloud, please send an email to support@betacloud.de. Please state that you are
       interested in using the OSISM testbed.

* `Citycloud <https://www.citycloud.com>`_

  .. note::

     * The credentials are stored in ``clouds.yaml`` and ``secure.yaml`` with the name ``citycloud``.

     * Registration is possible at the following URL: https://admin.citycloud.com/login?register=true

* `OVH <https://www.ovhcloud.com>`_

  .. note::

     * The credentials are stored in ``clouds.yaml`` and ``secure.yaml`` with the name ``ovh``.

     * Registration is possible at the following URL: https://us.ovhcloud.com/auth/signup/#/

     * The public L3 network services at OVH are currently still in beta. For more details, please
       visit https://labs.ovh.com/public-cloud-l3-services.

     * The use of private networks must be explicitly activated at OVH. A so-called vRack is created for this purpose.

     * There is a problem with creating multiple networks at once on OVH. Therefore the creation of the networks must
       be started several times
