# Requirements

## Infrastructure resources

### For an environment on a cloud

To use this testbed, a project on an OpenStack cloud environment is required.

The testbed requires the following virtual resources when using the default flavors:

* 1 keypair
* 6 security groups (50 security group rules)
* 6 networks with 6 subnetworks
* 1 router
* 30 ports
* 1 floating IP address
* 9 volumes (min 90 GB) plus 140GB root disks (depends on flavors)
* 4 instances (with 28 VCPUs and 104 GByte memory in total)

:::note

> If the cloud you are using does not offer a block storage service (Cinder), you can work with ephemeral
> volumes from the compute service (Nova).

:::

### For an environment on a hypervisor

If the testbed is to be deployed independently of the Terraform integration with
OpenStack, the following resources are required.

Each system needs a root disk with at least 30 GByte storage.

2 networks are required. A network with which the virtual systems can be accessed
and via which the virtual systems can communicate with the outside world. In addition,
a fully internal network.

* 1 virtual system which is used as manager and monitoring node (4 VCPUs, 16 GByte memory)
* 3 virtual systems which are used as control, compute and, storage nodes (8 VCPUs, 32 GByte memory)
  * 3 additional volumes per virtual system with at least 10 GByte storage each

Ubuntu 22.04 is to be used as the base image for the virtual systems.

## Software

* **make** must be installed on the system

### Ansible

Ansible in a current version must be installed and usable on the local workstation.

Currently Ansible 6.x is supported.

Information on installing Ansible can be found in the Ansible
documentation: <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html>

### Terraform

Terraform in a current version must be installed and usable on the local workstation.

Currently Terraform 1.2.x is supported.

Information on installing Terraform can be found in the Terraform
documentation: <https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli>

## This repository

The code for deploying the testbed is hosted in a git repository, you need to make
a local copy of it by running:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/src/github.com/osism
git clone https://github.com/osism/testbed ~/src/github.com/osism/testbed
```

:::note

> The repository can also be cloned to any other location. The path to this repository is set via the
> parameter **basepath**.

## Cloud access

:::note

> The necessary files are located in the **terraform** directory.

:::

There is a separate environment file, e.g. **environments/regiocloud.tfvars**, for
each supported cloud provider.

The environment to be used is set via the **ENVIRONMENT** environment variable.

```sh
export ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud
```

## Use of Application Credentials

The use of application credentials is preferred. This way it is not necessary to store
details like username or project name or sensitive information like the password in the
**clouds.yaml** file.

The application credentials can be found in Horizon under **Identity**.

![Create Application Credential in Horizon](./images/horizon-create-application-credential.png)

The **clouds.yaml** file of Fuga Cloud can be used as an example for the use of
application credentials. The **auth_url** is adapted accordingly.

> ```yaml
> ---
> clouds:
>   fuga:
>     auth:
>       auth_url: https://core.fuga.cloud:5000/v3
>       application_credential_id: "ID"
>       application_credential_secret: "SECRET"
>     interface: public
>     identity_api_version: 3
>     auth_type: "v3applicationcredential"
> ```
